# What is this?

An RSA implementation for Redot Engine.

# What needs to be done?

[ ] make a subroutine to take input + run through encrypt/decrypt
[ ] make a subroutine to convert input to values to {en,de,}crypt.
[ ] make a subroutine to contact client/server
[ ] I'm sure something else is missing

# Can I use this for anything other than redot?
Sure why not.

# What can I do to help?
Improve it. It's rudimentary right now.
